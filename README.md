# 3-jug-problem
The 3 jugs riddle typically involves three jugs with capacities of 12 liters, 8 liters, and 5 liters. The objective is to measure a specific quantity of liquid, usually 4 liters, using these jugs. Here's the solution:

Fill the 12-liter jug to its maximum capacity.

Pour the 12 liters from the 12-liter jug into the 8-liter jug. This leaves 4 liters in the 12-liter jug.

Empty the 8-liter jug.

Pour the remaining 4 liters from the 12-liter jug into the empty 8-liter jug.

Now, the 8-liter jug has 4 liters of liquid, and the 12-liter jug has 8 liters of liquid.

Fill the 5-liter jug with water.

Pour the 5 liters from the 5-liter jug into the 8-liter jug. This fills the 8-liter jug to its maximum capacity and leaves 1 liter in the 5-liter jug.

Empty the 8-liter jug.

Pour the 1 liter from the 5-liter jug into the empty 8-liter jug.

Fill the 5-liter jug again.

Pour the 5 liters from the 5-liter jug into the 8-liter jug. This fills the 8-liter jug to its maximum capacity, which is 6 liters, as it already had 1 liter from the previous step.

Now, you have 6 liters of liquid in the 8-liter jug.
